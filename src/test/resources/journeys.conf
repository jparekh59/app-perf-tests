# Configure here your journeys. A journey is a sequence of requests at a certain load.

# Example

#hello-world = {
#
#  # The description will appear in the test report. Use something meaningful
#  description = "Hello world journey"
#
#  # The load is in journeys per second. Put here the load you are going to have at the peak.
#  # There is no need to put a higher value at this point. Use prerftest.loadPercentage in application.conf instead
#  load = 9.1
#
#  # The parts your journey is made of. A part is made one or more requests.
#  parts = [
#    login,
#    home
#  ]
#}

# Default behaviour is to run all journeys. If that is not what you need you can specify the list of journeys to run
#journeysToRun = [
#   hello-world-1,
#   hello-world-3
#]

# You can specify the same list of journeys via environment variables:
# journeysToRun.0 = hello-world-1
# journeysToRun.1 = hello-world-3
